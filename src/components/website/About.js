              <p>
                JD Limited is India's No. 1 Local Search engine that provides
                local search related services to users across India through
                multiple platforms such as website, mobile website, Apps
                (Android, iOS), over the telephone (voice, pan India number
                8888888888) and text (SMS). Justdial has also initiated ‘Search
                Plus’ services for its users. These services aim at making
                several day-to-day tasks conveniently actionable and accessible
                to users through one App. By doing so, it has transitioned from
                being purely a provider of local search and related information
                to being an enabler of such transactions.
